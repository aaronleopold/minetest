Minetest Modding Associated Files


File System
* minetest/games/minimal/mods are where mods are located for our development purposes
* minetest/lib/lua houses the actual Lua subsystem. API documentation is located there as well 
* minetest/src contains the bulk of code/operation in C/C++ 
* minetest/src/server/mods.cpp&mods.h is where mods are loaded into server
* minetest/src/content - contains modpack.txt, modpack.conf, init.lua, game.conf that parse out mods and configure them
* minetest/src/scripting -initialize mod api’s here
* minetest/src/unittest - test api’s
* minetest/src/util - utility libraries - string/time/numeric/hex, etc…acts as a ”MineTest STL”
* minetest/util - build utilities
        
Parsing and Configuration  
* Minetest compiles a list of names of mods, gets associated dependencies, mods without unmet dependencies can be appended to sorted list, and then are written back to a list of unsatisfied mods
* A lot of “mod code” and data is written in lua, and then the C/C++ engine incorporates it into the rest of the program
