MineTest Modding Basics
General Syntax / Standard Practice
* Mods are supposed to be shorter than 90 chars per line
* Mods need commas after every statement or the mod will not work
* Use.png most of the time for textures (lossless)
* Depends file = loads dependencies. Use default to load default minetest libraries etc.
Recipes
* A Minetest recipe is equivalent to a table in Lua
* Recipe - list of items needed (no more than 9)
* NOTE: There is no automation tool to find conflicts, so be careful when making new recipes
Crafts
* Crafts can make things cookable, burnable, etc. 
* Crafts change behavior of objects
* Craft type “fuel” makes things burn
* Shapeless crafts can easily create conflicts with other crafts (not recommended)
Minetest methods
Register_node
Creates new object type
minetest.register_node("mod_1:first", {
  description = "Our very first node ever!",
  tiles = {"mod_1_first.png"},
  groups = {oddly_breakable_by_hand = 2},
})
* Name of mod within register_node
* Description - descriptive text that will be represented in game when hovering over node
* Tiles - texture mapped to all sides of the node
* Groups - TODO
Register_craft
Creates new crafting recipe
minetest.register_craft({
  output = "mod_1:first",
  recipe = {{"default:dirt", "default:dirt"}}
})


* Output - node that results from new recipe
* Recipe - formula to create node
